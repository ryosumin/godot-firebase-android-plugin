# **How to contribute**
This repository is organized using the **Trunk-based Development** pattern. This pattern is characterized by having a single main branch, also known as the trunk or master branch, where all changes are committed directly. This approach streamlines the development process and allows for efficient collaboration among team members.

## **How to contribute**
To contribute to the repository, developers should follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch on your fork.
2. Make the necessary changes on your branch.
3. Create a Pull Request (PR) to the master branch of the main repository.
4. Wait for the PR to be reviewed and approved by one of the repository maintainers.
5. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the master branch.

**Note**: It is important to note that all changes should be made on a separate branch, never on the master branch. This is to ensure that the master branch always contains stable and tested code.

Before making any contribution, please make sure to read the [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](COMMIT_CONVENTION.md) file, where you will find the correct way to commit and contribute to the project.
