# **Commit Convention**
## **Commit Message Format**
Each commit message consists of a header, a body, and a footer.

## **Header**
The header should be in the format of:

```md
- feat: (for new features)
- fix: (for bug fixes)
- docs: (for documentation)
- style: (for style changes)
- refactor: (for code refactoring)
- test: (for adding tests)
- chore: (for maintenance tasks)
```

## **Body**
The body should provide a clear and concise description of the change. Use the imperative present tense (e.g., "change" not "changed" or "changes").

## **Footer**
The footer should contain any relevant information such as issue numbers, breaking changes, or references to other commits.

## **Example**
```md
